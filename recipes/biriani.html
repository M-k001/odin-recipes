        <li>1l water</li>
        <li>full chicken</li>
        <li>1/4 cooking oil</li>

        <li>seasoning</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>STEPS</h4>


    <ol>
        <li>Start by marinating the chicken. In a large bowl, mix 1 kg of chicken pieces with 1 cup of yogurt, 2 tablespoons of ginger-garlic paste, 1 teaspoon each of turmeric, red chili powder, cumin powder, and coriander powder, along with salt to taste, the juice of half a lemon, and a handful of chopped mint and coriander leaves. Mix everything well, cover, and refrigerate for at least 1 hour or preferably overnight for best flavor.</li>
        <li>While the chicken marinates, prepare the rice. Rinse 2 cups of basmati rice until the water runs clear, then soak it in water for 30 minutes. In a large pot, bring water to a boil and add salt, 1 bay leaf, 2–3 green cardamoms, 4 cloves, and a small stick of cinnamon. Drain the soaked rice and add it to the boiling water. Cook until the rice is about 70% cooked—soft but still firm to the bite—then drain and set it aside.</li>
        <li>Next, cook the chicken. In a deep, heavy-bottomed pot, heat 2 tablespoons of cooking oil and 2 tablespoons of ghee. Add 2 thinly sliced onions and fry until they are golden brown. Then add 2 chopped tomatoes and cook until soft. Now add the marinated chicken and cook it over medium heat for about 10–12 minutes until the chicken is nearly cooked through and the oil begins to separate from the masala.</li>
        <li>Now it's time to layer the biryani. Reduce the heat and turn off the stove. Spread half of the cooked rice over the chicken evenly. Sprinkle some chopped mint and coriander leaves on top, along with a handful of fried onions (if available). Then add the remaining rice on top and drizzle with 1/4 cup of warm milk infused with saffron strands for aroma and color (optional). You may also add a few drops of rose water or kewra water for extra fragrance.</li>
        <li>Finally, steam the biryani using the “dum” method. Cover the pot tightly with a lid or seal it with foil to trap the steam. Turn the heat to very low and let it cook for 20–25 minutes. After that, turn off the heat and let the biryani rest for 10 minutes before opening the lid.</li>
